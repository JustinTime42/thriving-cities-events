Welcome to your new website!

I've created this with react, and it is fully responsive and looks great on any screen size. 

The content on this site is managed with Elegant CMS, and served through a heroku web server. This allows you to create and edit events without needing to know anything about web development or programming. The full work-flow for this process is very simple and more details can be found on this project Wiki. https://github.com/JustinTime42/thriving-cities-events/wiki

The event sign up is handled by a mailchimp sign-up form.This allows you to create new events with new mailing lists and guest lists easily without needing to mess with the website code itself.
